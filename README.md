# Introduction
Using Bootstrap is best when you want to build any web page. Here we will use the Bootstrap 4 to create different components and sections of a landing page. 

# Sections or Components
Let's understand what components are there in this bootstrap 4 landing page. You can use different sections customized according to your requirement for your website or landing page.

## Navigation Bar
The foremost component for any website or landing page is the Navigation Bar at the Top.

## Jumbotron
Jumbotron is a lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages on your site.

## Carousel
The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.

## Cards
A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.

## Embedded YouTube Video
In this section we have embadded the YouTube video with responsiveness.

## Features
This section we create the features with icons, headings, body and buttons optimized for responsiveness. 

## Testimonials
In the testimonial section we used the blockquotes and font awsome quote icon.

## Newsletter
The newsletter or basically lead capturing section requires basic but strong form. We used bootrap classes and modals to give it a perfect look.

## Footer
The last but not the least part of a website or webpage is it's footer. We created multicolumn responsive footer with various required html tags.

This template will serve as a ready reckoner for developing various other webpages. Hence, I will be adding more components as sections in this landing page or additional pages linked to this landing page. Your suggestions are welcome.
